        This website is dedicated to our investigation into the relationship between soil type and the biodiversity of plant life. Our project aims to explore 5 soil types around campus, count different species of plants and compare number of species in different areas. On this website, you can learn more about our research project, including our methods, results, and conclusions. You can also find information about the team members who worked on the project, as well as our sources of support.
